     Listening is an essential skill of the communication process. It 
is crucial for learning, getting along, and forming relationships. Do 
you think you are an active or passive listener? Listening is not a 
passive activity. Conversely, active listening is hearing what is being 
said and interpreting its meaning. Active listening makes you a more 
effective communicator because you react to what you have heard. 
Study the following steps to increase your listening skills. Do not cut 
people off; let them develop their ideas before you speak. If a message 
is vague, write down your questions or comments, and wait for the 
entire presentation or discussion to be finished. Reduce personal and 
environmental distractions by focusing on the message. Keep an open 
mind. Be attentive and maintain eye contact whenever possible. By 
developing these basic communication skills, you will become more 
confident and more effective.
