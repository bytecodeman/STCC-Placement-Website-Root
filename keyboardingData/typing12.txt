     As with anything, practice makes perfect, but along the way, we 
all make mistakes. The difference between the successful people and 
those who are less successful is not that the successful people make 
fewer mistakes. It's that they don't give up. Instead of letting mistakes 
bring them down, they use their mistakes as opportunities to grow. If 
you make a mistake, be patient with yourself. You might be able to fix 
your mistake. Look for more opportunities for success to be just 
around the corner.
