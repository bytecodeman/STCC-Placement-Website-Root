     A good manager must learn a new way to conduct more 
positive job reviews. Such a meeting might start by sizing up what the 
employee has done to help improve things in the past year. Positive 
comments may include coming to work on time, working well with 
others, and being willing to pitch in whenever needed. Next, the areas 
for improvement may be discussed. Then the employee should be 
given the chance to ask questions, write a response to the appraisal, 
and get other feedback.
