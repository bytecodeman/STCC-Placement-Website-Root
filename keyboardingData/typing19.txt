     You can be certain that no matter where you work, you will use 
some form of computer technology. Almost every business is 
dependent upon computers. Companies use such devices as voice 
mail, fax machines, cellular phones, and electronic schedules. 
Technology helps to accomplish work quickly and efficiently. A result 
of this rapidly changing technology is globalization, which is the 
establishment of worldwide communication links between people. 
Our world is becoming a smaller, global village. We must expand our 
thinking beyond the office walls. We must become aware of what 
happens in other parts of the world. Those events may directly affect 
you and your workplace. The more you know, the more valuable you 
will become to the company.
