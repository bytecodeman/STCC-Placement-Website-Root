     Most workers will learn about their success on the job at least 
once a year. The person in charge will be the one to conduct these 
reviews. Even though the job review is important, either party might 
not look forward to such a meeting. Frequently, an employee and a 
boss can view these meetings as a time to discuss everything that this 
person has done wrong in the last year. Such a negative approach can 
add a lot of stress and tension between the employee and 
management. In the long run, work performance suffers.
