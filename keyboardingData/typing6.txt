     Have you completed your education when you graduate from 
high school or finish your college work? Most people look forward to 
reaching milestones, such as graduation or completing a course. Have 
they learned everything they will need to know to be successful in the 
real world? The answer is not so simple.

     Learning continues to occur long after you leave the classroom. 
No matter what job or career you pursue, you will learn something 
new every day. When you investigate new ideas, ask questions, or 
find a different way to do a job, you are continuing to learn. In the 
process, you gain additional experience, develop new skills, and 
become a better worker.
