     In the past, typing was a skill that was used only by those who 
were secretaries, students, and office workers. High school students 
who were in school with plans for going on took a typing class so that 
they could type their work with ease and skill. Often students who 
wanted to be hired for office jobs would make a plan to take advanced 
courses in typing.

     As prices drop and as we have more and more advances in 
technology of all types, people are recognizing that they need 
keyboarding skills. From the top executive to the customer service 
representative, everyone needs to be able to use a computer keyboard. 
Workers in almost any kind of business use their keyboarding skills to 
perform their daily tasks.
