     Developing a career is a process. You have looked at your 
interests, values, skills, aptitudes, and attitudes. Your exploration into 
the world of work has begun. The journey doesn't stop here, for the 
present is the perfect place to start thinking about the future. It's 
where you begin to take steps toward your goals. It's where you can 
really make a difference. As you set personal and career goals, 
remember the importance of small steps. Each step toward a personal 
goal or career goal is a small victory. That feeling of success 
encourages you to take other small steps. Each step builds onto the 
next. Continue exploring your personal world as well as the world you 
share with others. Expect the best as you go forward. Expect a happy 
life. Expect loving relationships. Expect success in life. Expect 
fulfilling and satisfying work in a job you truly love. Last but not 
least, expect that you have something special to offer the world, 
because you do.
