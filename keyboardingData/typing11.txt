     Keyboarding is a popular business course for many students. 
The major objectives of a keyboarding course are to develop touch 
control of the keyboard and proper typing techniques, build basic 
speed and accuracy, and provide practice in applying those basic skills 
to the formatting of letters, reports, tables, memos, and other kinds of 
personal and business communications. In the early part of a 
keyboarding course, students learn to stroke by touch using specific 
techniques. They learn to hit the keys in a quick and accurate way. 
After the keys are learned and practiced, students move into 
producing documents of all sizes and types for personal and 
vocational use.
