     When you begin to think about a career, you should assess your 
personal abilities and interests. Do you have a natural aptitude in a 
certain area? Do you have special interests or hobbies that you would 
like to develop into a career? Do you enjoy working with other 
people, or do you like to work on your own? Would you like to work 
in a large office, or do you prefer to work outdoors? These questions 
are important to consider when you think about your career.
