     Holding a job is a major part of being an adult. Some people 
begin their work careers as adolescents. From the beginning, various 
work habits are developed that are as crucial to success as the actual 
job skills and knowledge that a person brings to the job. What traits 
are expected of workers? What do employers look for when they 
evaluate their employees? Important personal traits include being 
confident, cooperative, positive, and dependable. If you are organized, 
enthusiastic, and understanding, you have many of the qualities that 
employers value most in their employees.
