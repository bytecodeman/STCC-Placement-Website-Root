     It can be concluded that certain work habits or traits can play a 
major role in determining the success of an employee. Most managers 
would be quick to agree on the importance of these traits. It is most 
probable that these habits would be evaluated on performance 
appraisal forms. Promotions, pay increases, new responsibilities, and 
your future with the company may be based on these evaluations. You 
should request regular job performance evaluations even if your 
company does not conduct them. This feedback will improve your job 
performance and career development by helping you grow. If you 
continually look for ways to improve your work habits and skills, then 
you will enjoy success in the workplace and beyond.
