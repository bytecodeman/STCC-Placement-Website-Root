     Be patient with yourself when handling problems and accepting 
criticism. Handling criticism gracefully and maturely may be a 
challenge. Still, it is vital in the workplace. Criticism presented in a 
way that can help you learn and grow is constructive criticism. When 
you see criticism as helpful, it's easier to handle. Believe it or not, 
there are some employees who welcome criticism. It teaches them 
better ways to succeed on the job. Strive to improve how you accept 
constructive criticism, and embrace your growth.
