     All problem solving, whether personal or academic, involves 
decision making. You make decisions in order to solve problems. On 
occasion, problems occur as a result of decision you have made. For 
example, you may decide to smoke, but later in life, you face the 
problem of nicotine addiction. You may decide not to study 
mathematics and science because you think that they are too difficult. 
Because of this choice, many career opportunities will be closed to 
you. There is a consequence for every action. Do you see that events 
in your life do not just happen, but that they are the result of your 
choices and decisions?
