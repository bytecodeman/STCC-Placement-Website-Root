     People experience continuous growth during a career. Goal 
setting is a helpful tool along any career path. Some people believe 
that goals provide the motivation needed to get to the place they want 
to be. Setting goals encourages greater achievements. The higher we 
set our goals, the greater the effort we will need to reach these goals. 
Each time we reach a target or come closer to a goal, we see an 
increase in our confidence and our performance, leading to greater 
accomplishments. And the cycle continues to spiral onward and 
upward.
