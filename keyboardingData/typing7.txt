     The ability to organize is an important quality for the employee who 
wishes to display good work habits.  The worker should have the ability to 
plan the work that needs to be completed and then be able to execute the 
plan in a timely manner.  An employer requires a competent worker to be 
well organized.  If an office worker is efficient, he or she handles requests 
swiftly and deals with correspondence without delay.  The organized worker 
does not allow work to accumulate on the desk.  Also, the organized office 
worker returns all phone calls immediately and makes lists of the activities 
that need to be done each day.
