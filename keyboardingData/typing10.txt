     Speaking is also a form of communication. In the world of 
work, speaking is an important way in which to share information. 
Regardless of whether you are speaking to an audience of one or one 
hundred, you will want to make sure that your listeners get your 
message. Be clear about your purpose, your audience, and your 
subject. A purpose is the overall goal or reason for speaking. An 
audience is anyone who receives information. The subject is the main 
topic or key idea. Research your subject. Using specific facts and 
examples will give you credibility. As you speak, be brief and direct. 
Progress logically from point to point. Speak slowly and pronounce 
clearly all your words. Do people understand what you say or ask you 
to repeat what you've said? Is the sound of your voice friendly and 
pleasant or shrill and off-putting? These factors influence how your 
message is received. A good idea is worthless if you can't 
communicate it.
