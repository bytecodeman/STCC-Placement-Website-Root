     Efficiency is another work habit that is desired. An efficient 
worker completes a task quickly and begins work on the next project 
eagerly. He or she thinks about ways to save steps and time. For 
example, an efficient worker may plan a single trip to the copier with 
several copying jobs rather than multiple trips to do each separate job. 
Being efficient also means having the required supplies to 
successfully complete each job. An efficient employee zips along on 
each project, uses time wisely, and stays focused on the present task. 
With careful and thorough planning, a worker who is efficient can 
accomplish more tasks in less time.
